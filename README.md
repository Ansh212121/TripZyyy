## 📦 Deployment

### Frontend – Vercel

* Connect GitHub repo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
* Add environment variables in **Project Settings → Environment**

### Backend – Railway or Render

* Create a new project on [Railway](https://railway.app) or [Render](https://render.com)
* Deploy Express backend (optional if only using Next.js API)
* Add the same `.env` variables
* Hit deploy 🚀

---

## 🛡️ Security Tips
